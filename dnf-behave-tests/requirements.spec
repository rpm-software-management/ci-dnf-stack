# This package is not meant to be built, it's for installing the test suite
# dependencies.
#
# Run the following command to install the dependencies:
# $ dnf builddep ci-dnf-stack.spec
#
# Some of the dependencies may not be available as RPMs on the target system.
# We use pip for those:
# $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
