Feature: Test upgrade, upgrade-minimal, and check-ugrade with advisory, cve, secseverity


Background: Use repository with advisories
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-security"
   When I execute dnf with args "install advisory_A-1.0-1 advisory_B-1.0-1"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                   |
        | install       | advisory_A-0:1.0-1.x86_64 |

Scenario: upgrade-minimal cve and advisory
   When I execute dnf with args "upgrade-minimal --cve CVE-001 --advisory DNF-BUGFIX-001"

Scenario: check-upgrade --minimal cve and advisory
   When I execute dnf with args "check-upgrade --minimal --cves CVE-001 --advisories DNF-BUGFIX-001"
   Then the exit code is 100
    And stdout matches line by line
