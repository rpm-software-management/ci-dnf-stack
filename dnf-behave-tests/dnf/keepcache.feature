Feature: Tests related to keepcache functionality


Background:
  Given I use repository "simple-base"


Scenario: Keepcache set to false removes installed packages from cache
   When I execute dnf with args "install labirinto"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | labirinto-0:1.0-1.fc29.x86_64             |
   When I execute "find -type f -name '*.rpm' | sort" in "{context.dnf.installroot}/var/cache/dnf"
   Then stdout is empty


Scenario: Keepcache set to true keeps installed packages in cache
   When I execute dnf with args "--setopt=keepcache=true install labirinto"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | labirinto-0:1.0-1.fc29.x86_64             |
   When I execute "find -type f -name '*.rpm' | sort" in "{context.dnf.installroot}/var/cache/dnf"
   Then stdout matches line by line
   """
   \./simple-base-[0-9a-f]{16}/packages/labirinto-1\.0-1\.fc29\.x86_64\.rpm

Scenario: Keepcache set to false does not remove command-line packages
   When I execute dnf with args "install file://{context.dnf.fixturesdir}/repos/simple-base/x86_64/labirinto-1.0-1.fc29.x86_64.rpm"
   Then the exit code is 0

Scenario: Keepcache set to false does not remove packages from download command after the following successful transaction
  Given I set working directory to "{context.dnf.tempdir}"
   When I execute dnf with args "download labirinto"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And file "/{context.dnf.tempdir}/labirinto-1.0-1.fc29.x86_64.rpm" exists
   When I execute dnf with args "install labirinto"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | labirinto-0:1.0-1.fc29.x86_64             |
    And file "/{context.dnf.tempdir}/labirinto-1.0-1.fc29.x86_64.rpm" exists


Scenario: Reseting keepcache does not remove previously kept packages from cache
   When I execute dnf with args "--setopt=keepcache=true install labirinto vagare"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following

# Test that a package that was cached in the previous transaction (the 'vagare' package)
