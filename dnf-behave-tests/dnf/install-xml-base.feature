Feature: Install packages with base:xml set


@dnf5daemon
@dnf5
Scenario: Installed packages from local repository with local xml:base are not cached
Given I copy repository "dnf-ci-fedora" for modification
  And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
  And I generate repodata for repository "dnf-ci-fedora" with extra arguments "--baseurl file://{context.dnf.installroot}/temp-repo/xml_base/dnf-ci-fedora"
  # setup data to which the base:xml (createrepo_c --baseurl argument) is pointing
  And I copy directory "{context.dnf.repos[dnf-ci-fedora].path}" to "/temp-repo/xml_base/dnf-ci-fedora"
 When I execute dnf with args "--setopt=keepcache=true install setup"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And Transaction is following
      | Action        | Package                                  |
      | install       | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch             |
  And file "/var/cache/dnf/dnf-ci-fedora_with_baseurl*/packages/setup*" does not exist

Scenario: Install from local repodata with xml:base pointing to remote packages
Given I make packages from repository "dnf-ci-fedora" accessible via http
  And I copy repository "dnf-ci-fedora" for modification
  And I generate repodata for repository "dnf-ci-fedora" with extra arguments "--baseurl http://localhost:{context.dnf.ports[dnf-ci-fedora]}"
  And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
 When I execute dnf with args "--setopt=keepcache=true install setup"

Scenario: Install from remote repodata with xml:base pointing to packages on different HTTP servers
Given I make packages from repository "dnf-ci-fedora" accessible via http
  And I copy repository "dnf-ci-fedora" for modification
  And I generate repodata for repository "dnf-ci-fedora" with extra arguments "--baseurl http://localhost:{context.dnf.ports[dnf-ci-fedora]}"
  And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora" as http
 When I execute dnf with args "install setup"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And stderr is empty
  And Transaction is following
      | Action        | Package                                  |
