Feature: Add package to needs-restarting using config files

Background:
Given I use repository "needs-restarting"
  And I move the clock backward to "before boot-up"
  And I execute dnf with args "install wget abcde"
  And I move the clock forward to "2 hours"
  And I use repository "needs-restarting-updates"
  And I create directory "/etc/dnf/plugins/needs-restarting.d"
  And I create and substitute file "/etc/dnf/plugins/needs-restarting.d/wget.conf" with
  """
  wget
  """


@bz1810123
Scenario: plugin does not fail if config directory not found
Given I delete directory "/etc/dnf/plugins/needs-restarting.d/"
 When I execute dnf with args "needs-restarting -r"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And stdout is
  """
  No core libraries or services have been updated since boot-up.
  Reboot should not be necessary.

@bz1810123
Scenario: restarting needed after updating package in conf files
Given I execute dnf with args "upgrade wget"
 When I execute dnf with args "needs-restarting -r"

  And stdout is
