Feature: dnf-automatic reports an error when transaction failed


Background:
Given I use repository "dnf-ci-automatic-update"


# First, install the "test-1.0" package, which should proceed successfully.
# Then, attempt to update to "test-1.1", which contains a broken scriptlet.
# An error should be reported during the installation of the update.

Scenario: dnf-automatic reports an error when package installation failed
  Given I successfully execute dnf with args "install test-1.0"
   When I execute dnf with args "automatic --installupdates"
   Then the exit code is 1
    And RPMDB Transaction is empty
    And stdout contains "Failed to install upgrades."
    And stdout contains "Error in pre-install scriptlet"
    And stdout contains "Transaction failed: Rpm transaction failed."
