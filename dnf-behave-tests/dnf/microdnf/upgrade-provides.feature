Feature: Upgrade RPMs by provides


Background: Install glibc
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
    # "/usr" directory is needed to load rpm database (to overcome bad heuristics in libdnf created by Colin Walters)
    And I create directory "/usr"
   When I execute microdnf with args "install glibc"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And microdnf transaction is
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | glibc-0:2.28-9.fc29.x86_64                |
        | install-dep   | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch              |
