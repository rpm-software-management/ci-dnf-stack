Scenario: --security upgrade with advisories with pkgs of different arches
Given I use repository "security-upgrade"
  And I execute dnf with args "install json-c-1-1 bind-libs-lite-1-1"
 When I execute dnf with args "upgrade --security"
 Then the exit code is 0
  And Transaction is following
      | Action        | Package                     |
      | upgrade       | bind-libs-lite-0:2-2.x86_64 |
      | upgrade       | json-c-0:2-2.x86_64         |

# This scenario is the same as the one above just with noarch packages present in the
# repo and advisory instead of i686 this causes different behavior - it fails.
# Technically we could get bz2088149 again with just a different package set.
# However while this is possible it shouldn't happen because noarch packages are special - they work
# on all architectures and we shouldn't see noarch builds together with arch specific builds as it
# is setup in this scenario (in repo security-upgrade-noarch).
