Feature: Tests for group list and info commands

Background: Enable repo and mark a group as installed
 Given I use repository "comps-group-list"
 Given I create file "/usr/lib/sysimage/libdnf5/groups.toml" with
    """
    version = "1.0"

    [groups]

    [groups.test-group]
    userinstalled = true
    """

Scenario: All user visible groups are listed by default (installed group is not duplicated)
  When I execute dnf with args "group list"
  Then the exit code is 0
   And stderr is

Scenario Outline: Info command accepts <option> option
  When I execute dnf with args "group info <option>"
  Then the exit code is 0

Examples:
    | option                |
    | --hidden              |
    | --installed           |
    | --available           |
    | --contains-pkgs=pkg   |
