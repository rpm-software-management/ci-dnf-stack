Feature: Tests for environment list and info commands


Background: Enable repo and mark an environment as installed
 Given I use repository "comps-group-list"
   And I create file "/usr/lib/sysimage/libdnf5/environments.toml" with
       """
       version = "1.0"
       [environments]

       test-environment = {groups = [], userinstalled = true}
       """

Scenario: I can list environments (installed environment is not duplicated)
  When I execute dnf with args "environment list"
  Then the exit code is 0
   And stderr is
       """
       <REPOSYNC>
       """
   And stdout is
       """

Scenario: I can filter listed environments by their ids

Scenario Outline: Info command accepts <option> option
  When I execute dnf with args "environment info <option>"
  Then the exit code is 0

Examples:
    | option                |
    | --installed           |
    | --available           |
