Feature: Tests for environment list and info commands


Background: Enable repo and mark an environment as installed
 Given I use repository "comps-group-list"
   And I successfully execute dnf with args "group install test-environment"

Scenario: I can list environments (installed environment is not duplicated)

Scenario Outline: Info command accepts <option> option
  When I execute dnf with args "environment info <option>"
  Then the exit code is 0

Examples:
    | option                |
    | --installed           |
    | --available           |
