Feature: Check when there is a package with missing dependency


Scenario Outline: Check <option>
   When I execute rpm with args "-i --nodeps {context.dnf.fixturesdir}/repos/dnf-ci-fedora/x86_64/filesystem-3.9-2.fc29.x86_64.rpm"
   Then the exit code is 0
   When I execute dnf with args "check <option>"
   Then the exit code is 1
    And stdout is
    """
    filesystem-0:3.9-2.fc29.x86_64
     missing require "setup"
    """
    And stderr is
    """
    Check discovered 1 problem(s) in 1 package(s)
    """

Examples:
        | option             |
        # no option defaults to "all"
        |                    |
        | --dependencies     |


Scenario Outline: Check <option>
   When I execute rpm with args "-i --nodeps {context.dnf.fixturesdir}/repos/dnf-ci-fedora/x86_64/filesystem-3.9-2.fc29.x86_64.rpm"
   Then the exit code is 0
   When I execute dnf with args "check <option>"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout is empty
    And stderr is empty

Examples:
        | option             |
        | --duplicates       |
        | --obsoleted        |
