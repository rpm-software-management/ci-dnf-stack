Feature: Test the system-upgrade command

Background:
Given I use repository "system-upgrade-f$releasever" with configuration
  # Install the initial package versions first, then set the (target)
  # releasever and switch the repositories to http (so that system-upgrade
  # actually downloads the packages instead of using the local path). It is not
  # possible to set up an http server for a repository with two different
  # releasever variations.

  And I use repository "system-upgrade-2-f$releasever" with configuration
      | key         | value |
      | priority    | 2     |
  And I successfully execute dnf with args "install pkg-a pkg-b pkg-both"
  And I set releasever to "30"
  And I use repository "system-upgrade-f$releasever" as http
  And I use repository "system-upgrade-2-f$releasever" as http
  And I set environment variable "DNF_SYSTEM_UPGRADE_NO_REBOOT" to "1"
