Feature: Install an obsoleted RPM


Scenario: Install an obsoleted RPM
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-thirdparty"
   When I execute dnf with args "install glibc-profile"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                                   |
        | install       | glibc-profile-0:2.3.1-10.x86_64           |
    And package state is
        | package                       | reason | from_repo         |
        | glibc-profile-2.3.1-10.x86_64 | User   | dnf-ci-thirdparty |
    And dnf5 transaction items for transaction "last" are
        | action  | package                         | reason     | repository        |
        | Install | glibc-profile-0:2.3.1-10.x86_64 | User       | dnf-ci-thirdparty |


Scenario: Install an obsoleted RPM when the obsoleting RPM is available
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-thirdparty"
   When I execute dnf with args "install glibc-profile"
