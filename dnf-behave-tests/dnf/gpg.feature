Feature: Testing gpgcheck


# Masterkey signed packages in repository dnf-ci-gpg:
#     setup
#     abcde
#     broken-package
#     glibc
#     glibc-common
#     glibc-all-langpacks
# Subkey signed packages in repository dnf-ci-gpg:
#     filesystem
#     filesystem-content
# Incorrectly signed packages:
#     basesystem in dnf-ci-gpg is signed with key from dnf-ci-gpg-updates
#     basesystem in dnf-ci-gpg-updates is signed with key from dnf-ci-gpg

   When I execute dnf with args "repolist"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout contains "dnf-ci-gpg\s+dnf-ci-gpg"
      # At the start of each test, there are no imported gpg keys in RPM DB
   When I execute rpm with args "-q gpg-pubkey"
   Then the exit code is 1
