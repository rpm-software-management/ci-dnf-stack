Feature: SSL related tests


Scenario: Installing a package from https repository
  Given I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora" as https
   When I execute dnf with args "repolist"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout contains "dnf-ci-fedora\s+dnf-ci-fedora"
   When I execute dnf with args "install filesystem"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                               |
        | install       | filesystem-0:3.9-2.fc29.x86_64        |
        | install-dep   | setup-0:2.12.1-1.fc29.noarch          |


Scenario: Installing a package from https repository with client verification
  Given I require client certificate verification with certificate "certificates/testcerts/client/cert.pem" and key "certificates/testcerts/client/key.pem"
    And I use repository "dnf-ci-fedora" as https
   When I execute dnf with args "repolist"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And stdout is
       """
       repo id       repo name
       dnf-ci-fedora dnf-ci-fedora test repository
       """
   When I execute dnf with args "install filesystem"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                               |
        | install       | filesystem-0:3.9-2.fc29.x86_64        |

Scenario: Installing a package using untrusted client cert should fail

   Then the exit code is 1

        # DNF stack. This most likely happens for all SSL connections, but is

        # error typically occurs two or three times (when it happens at all).
